## Development

### Running Locally

```bash
python app.py
```

### Populating Vector Database

```bash
python document_processor.py
```

## Using the Test Client

The `test_client.py` provides a command-line interface for testing the chat API. It supports both text-only conversations and image+text queries.

### Running the Test Client
```bash
python test_client.py
```

### Available Commands
- `quit` - Exit the program
- `reset` - Start a new session
- `image "path/to/image.jpg" Your message here` - Send an image with accompanying text

### Examples

1. Text-only conversation:
```
> How can I improve my property's curb appeal?
AI: [Response about property improvements]
```

2. Sending an image with text:
```
> image "photos/house_front.jpg" What issues do you see with this property?
AI: [Analysis of the property image and response]
```

### Image Requirements
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG
- Path must be in quotes
- Message is required after the image path

### Example Session
```
Chat API Client
Commands:
  'quit' - Exit the program
  'reset' - Start new session
  'image "path" message' - Send message with image (path must be in quotes)
Session ID: None

> image "house.jpg" What's wrong with this house?
AI: [Analysis of house image]

> How much would those repairs cost?
AI: [Response about repair costs]

> reset
Session reset successfully

> quit
```

### Troubleshooting
- If image path is not found: Check that the path is correct and use forward slashes
- If image fails to send: Ensure the image format is supported and file is not corrupted
- If no response: Check that the server is running and accessible
